For a high level overview of what this does, check this 
blog post:

For the legislation defining the system we are implementing, see the `legislation` directory of the repository.
The counting algorithm is defined in Section 273. Other sections define the rules around formality of ballots.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcomed, please feel free to send in pull requests.

Please abide by [The Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html)
when contributing to or otherwise engaging this project.

Please check that the tests pass before committing. See `travis_tests.sh`
in the root of the repository. This includes a lint pass, running `flake8 --ignore=E501 dividebatur`.
Make sure you've got flake8 installed for python3 (you should only need
to run `pip3 install flake8`.)

Of course, if there is a bug in the tests, please correct the tests
and include in the PR.

Right now there are fairly minimal unit tests, written using nose.
It's a goal to increase the coverage of unit tests.

There are quite a few functional tests, checking that known-correct
election results don't vary. These do pick up quite a few regressions,
but could certainly be improved.

## Usage

`git lfs pull` will download the large data files.

`./run_aec_fed2013_wa.sh` will run a count of the 2013/14 WA Senate count .
The data is in the repository under `aec_data/fed2013_wa`.

`./run_aec_fed2016.sh` will run a count for all states with data available,
for the 2016 federal election. The data is in the repository under `aec_data/fed2016`.

## Structure
senatecount.py builds up the initial data needed to begin the count, and then hands it to counter.py

counter.py processes the vote. Note it may require user input to break ties which occur choosing a candidate 
to exclude, choosing the order of election, or choosing the final candidate elected.
